                <h2>Linguistic Linked Open Data: [Aug 2016]</h2>
                <p>The OLAC system has now been integrated with the
                    Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud. Linked Data is "a recommended best practice for
                    exposing,
                    sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information, and knowledge on the Semantic Web using URIs
                    and RDF." This opens the way for the contents of OLAC's 60 participating archives to be interlinked
                    and queried. Visit link <a href="https://linguistic-lod.org/">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Archive submission policies: [Nov 2015]</h2>
                <p>As a service to linguists who are in search of an archive that could receive a deposit of language
                    resources they have created, this page lists all of the OLAC participants who have published their
                    submission policy as part of their OLAC repository. Visit link <a

                <h2>New OLAC Search Service: [Dec 2010]</h2>
                <p>In December 2010, to mark our 10th anniversary, OLAC announces a new search service. Sponsored by the
                    National Science Foundation, and hosted by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, the service
                    provides powerful search over the combined catalog of all resources from all participating archives.
                    It is based on the "faceted search" strategy, in which search results are successively narrowed by
                    clicking on available values of standardized descriptors like language, language family, country,
                    linguistic subfield, data type, format, and more. Visit link <a

                <h2>OLAC Presents at DRIVER Summit: [Jan 2008]</h2>
                <p>In January 2008, the DRIVER project (Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research)
                    convened a Summit to present results of its initial test-bed phase and to pave the way for
                    establishing an operational confederation of digital repositories. DRIVER responds to the vision
                    that all relevant scientific content should be easily accessible through internet-based
                    infrastructures. Like OLAC, DRIVER builds on the OAI (Open Archives Initiative) infrastructure. OLAC
                    was invited to present its work on developing a "thematic" federation of repositories focused on
                    language resources.</p>
